# Predictive Maintenance for Device Failure Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict device failures based on daily telemetry data readings. By analyzing the historical data, the model will forecast the likelihood of a failure, enabling proactive maintenance. This predictive maintenance approach reduces unnecessary maintenance tasks, leading to significant cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the probability of device failure, with a focus on minimizing both false positives and false negatives. The model classifies devices into two categories:

0 for non-failure (device is operating normally)
1 for failure (device requires maintenance)

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of telemetry data from a fleet of devices. Each record in the dataset represents a daily reading from a device, and includes various features related to device performance, such as:
Date
Device ID
Failure status (target column)
Metrics like temperature, pressure, voltage, etc.

## Machine Learning Approach
This project employs machine learning techniques to predict failure, using features from the telemetry data. The main steps in the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the raw telemetry data.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating features that are relevant for predicting failure.
Model Building: Implementing classification algorithms, such as Gradient Boosting, to build a predictive model.
Evaluation: Evaluating model performance with metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC to ensure the model effectively minimizes false positives and false negatives.
